## Projects
Projects folder is used to store all the repositories needed for experiment, it contains only two samples now. You need to run run_setup.py to supplement the remaining samples.

## PromptAndResult
PromptAndResult.zip contains the results of our experiment, including the generated prompts and generated test methods.

## test.json
test.zip is the test set for experiment, sourced from test.json in https://github.com/CEPROTest/CEPROT/blob/master/data/gen.zip. I obtained the complete production class before and after the update and the test class before and after the update through the GitHub repository name, file path, commit id and other information in the test.json to build the test set for experiment.
